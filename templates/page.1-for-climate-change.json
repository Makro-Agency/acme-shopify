Established in 2021 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we are a living tribute to Eric Caslow, a third-generation owner of the Acme Smoked Fish Corporation. Eric's unwavering commitment to the seafood sector drove us to create a platform that champions the future of this industry.</p><p>Our mission transcends mere business. We aim to ensure that the seafood industry thrives even in the face of global challenges like climate change. We strive to achieve this by fostering innovation and education in the regions we serve, and by pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p><p>One of our flagship initiatives, the Seafood Industry Climate Awards (SICA), seeks to amplify solutions that reduce the seafood industry's carbon footprint. But we don't stop there. We're dedicated to elevating the roles of underrepresented groups within the industry, believing that diversity is key to unlocking sustainable solutions.</p><p>ASF is more than just a foundation. We're a community of passionate individuals, driven by the belief that change is possible through collaboration. Our extensive network, including influential figures like Rob Snyder and strategic collaborators like Context Partners, solidifies our position at the intersection of seafood, sustainability, and societal change.</p><p>We're on a mission to accelerate promising solutions, build resilient communities, and leave a lasting impact on the seafood industry and the planet.</p><h3><em><strong>What are some examples of climate initiatives that are being funded with this donation?</strong></em></h3><p>Visit <a href=\"https://acmesmokedfish.com/pages/seafood-and-climate-initiatives\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">https://acmesmokedfish.com/pages/seafood-and-climate-initiatives</span></a> or read more about our 2023 Seafood Industry Climate Award winners below:</p><p><strong>Minorities in Aquaculture</strong></p><p>Minorities in Aquaculture (MIA) was founded in 2020 by Imani Black, an African American oyster farmer building a career in the rapidly-growing aquaculture industry. The organization was created by a vision of more diverse and inclusive aquaculture sectors. In 3 years, MIA has educated underrepresented demographics about the environmental benefits of aquaculture & growing a viable career pipeline. Their goal is to create long-lasting diverse stewards, employees and innovators that strongly impact the industry for the future. </p><p><strong>Pine Island Redfish</strong></p><p>Pine Island Redfish is a saltwater, land-based Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) producing redfish in Southwest Florida. Their RAS system brings home production of a native fish, almost harvested to extinction. Rather than relying on imports, Pine Island Redfish meets the demand of this popular species while also establishing a more circular food system. The RAS facility captures and reuses the nutrient profile of the seawater to grow halophytic plants such as sea purslane and red mangrove. This addresses management of waste from marine culture, raising plant species that are integral to shoreline stabilization and carbon sequestration.</p><p><strong>Viable Gear </strong></p><p>Viable Gear is a mission-driven startup founded in 2021 in Portland, Maine to provide sustainable products to ocean harvesters in support of a healthier ocean. These products are developed from<br/>Viable Gear’s seaweed-based material alternative, intended to replace the traditional petroleum based plastics like nylon and polypropylene, that are used in the fishing and aquaculture industries.</p><h3><em><strong>Why are climate initiatives the focus of the Acme Smoked Fish Foundation?</strong></em></h3><p>Time is of the essence. Climate related impacts are already disrupting the seafood industry, with more to come, potentially leading to the collapse of fisheries, economies, and viability of the sector. The Acme Smoked Fish Foundation believes that if innovators, from researchers to product developers to entrepreneurs, have increased attention and resources, they can help turn the tide and allow the seafood industry to be a leader in the climate movement.</p><h3><em><strong>Why Acme’s cold smoked salmon products?</strong></em></h3><p>To make the biggest impact! Acme’s cold smoked salmon products are our most popular selling items, so adding our 1% for Climate Initiatives label to those items allows us to fund more innovative solutions to decarbonize the seafood industry.</p><p></p>",

By installing solar panels on their farm and hatchery, they aim to buffer disruptions to their food system brought on by climate change. </p><p><strong>Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association Boat Energy Transition Accelerator: ALFA BETA</strong></p><p></p><p>Fuel usage in wild capture fisheries contribute significantly to carbon emission and high costs in the seafood industry. The ALFA BETA SICA Award takes on this challenge, piloting technology that will lead the way for the electrification of the SE Alaska Troll and Long Line Fleet.
