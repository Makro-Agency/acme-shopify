The first thing to know? The hot in “hot smoked” refers to temperature, not spice. We stoke our fire until it reaches 165°F or higher, smoking the fish until it settles at an internal temp of 145°F, which usually takes a few hours. Then, it’s all about enjoying the bold flavor and firm, flaky bite. <\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Factory-NY-JR-002.jpg","link_label":"","link_url":"","external":false}},"4be1a7e2-5ec1-47d6-8806-2f70a18ffad1":{"type":"content","settings":{"lead":"","header":"Cold Smoking","body":"<p>A careful craft that preserves the silky, raw-like texture of the fish, cold smoking requires patience, discretion, and a delicate touch. With our expert smokers tending to the fire, we keep our smokehouse at 90°F or lower—cool enough to avoid denaturing the proteins of the fish, warm enough to welcome layers of flavor. For up to 12 hours, the fish rests in this controlled haze of woodsmoke. By law, we reserve this process for tuna, salmon, and sable. By love, we’ve built our name on it. <\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Factory-NY-046.jpg","link_label":"","link_url":"","external":false}}},"block_order":["ca1a949d-00aa-478a-a2c6-603f81f09841","4be1a7e2-5ec1-47d6-8806-2f70a18ffad1"],"settings":{"anchor_id":"","color":"light","link_url":""}},"29a1559d-7167-4888-9b33-3352f47c05be":{"type":"two-column-swiper","blocks":{"ec92bcfa-0bd4-4fa6-ae63-e79559b83106":{"type":"Slide","settings":{"anchor_id":"","label":"","header":"Optional Section to Provide More Information","title":"","sub_title":"","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/the-fish.jpg","image_size":"cover","body":"<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
